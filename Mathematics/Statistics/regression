What is Regression analysis
In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating
the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome variable')
and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features').
from wikipedia

Regression analysis is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes.
First, regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting,
where its use has substantial overlap with the field of machine learning.
Second, in some situations regression analysis can be used to infer causal
relationships between the independent and dependent variables.
Importantly, regressions by themselves only reveal relationships between a dependent variable
and a collection of independent variables in a fixed dataset. To use regressions for prediction
or to infer causal relationships, respectively, a researcher must carefully justify why existing
relationships have predictive power for a new context or why a relationship between two variables
has a causal interpretation. The latter is especially important when researchers hope to estimate
causal relationships using observational data. - from wikipedia

Summary
Regression is primarily used for two conceptually distinct purposes (두가지 이유에서 많이 사용된다)
1. Regression analysis is widely used for prediction and forecasting.
Note -> 모델링한 X의 범위 내에서 새로운 X*값에 대한 Y값을 알고자하는 것을 Prediction 라고 보고,
 모델링하는 X의 범위를 벗어난 새로운 X의 값에 대한 Y값을 알고자 하는 것을 Forecast 라고 보면 됨
