Mathematical Modelling
A mathematical model is a simplication of a real-world situation.
It can be used to make predictions and forecasts about real-world situation.
This helps solve and improve the understanding of real-world situations by analysing the results and the model.

The model will aim to include all the main features of the real-world situations but, give the difficulties
of real world, the model may have to be based on certain assumptions. As a result, these assumptions will need to be taken
into considerations when analyzing the results.

Summarize
-> Model is a simplication of a real-world situation
-> Model cannot perfectly represent the real-world
-> Model may have to be based on assumptions
-> Still, it has many advantages

Advantages include (but not limited to)
- relatively quick an easy to produce
- usually much more cost-effective way of analysing the real-world situation
- enable predictions to be made
- help improve the understanding of our world
- help show how certain (variables) will affect the outcomes
- help simplify complex situations

However, mathematical models do have some disadvantages,
and these include:
- simplification can cause errors  -> as they do not include all aspects of the problem and may have included assumptions
- The model may work only in certain conditions that are difficult or expensive to fulfil in the real world

Designing a model
The process of designing a model generally involves seven stages, outlined below,
1. The recognition of a real-world problem
    -> 문제를 알아야 문제를 푼다!
2. A mathematical model is devised
    -> 수학적 모델 만들기
3. Model used to make predictions about the behavior of the real world problem
4. Experimental data are collected form the real world
5. comparisons are made against the devised model
6. Statistical concepts are used to test how well the model describes the real world problem
7. Model is refiend
