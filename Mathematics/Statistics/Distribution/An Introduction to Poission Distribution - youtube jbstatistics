Poission Distribution

a Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that can be used to show
how many times an event is likely to occur within a specified period of time
(Discrete)

Poisson distributions are often used to understand independent events that
occur at a constant rate within a given interval of time.

key note
1. How many times an event is likely to occur within a specified period of time
2. Often used to understand independent events
3. that occur at a constant rate
4. within a given interval of time

e.g
Suppose we are counting the number of occurences of an event in a given unit of time, distance, area, or volume.

For example:
    - The number of car accidents in a day.
    - The number of dandelions(민들레) in a square metre plot of land.

Then the number of events is going to be a random variable
that may or may nor have the poisson distribution depending on situation.

Poission random variable is a count of number of occurrences of an event

Characteristics of poission distribution
    - Events are occuring indepdently
        - Events of A does not affect event of B
    - The proability that an event occurs in a given length of time does not change through time
    meaning (Events are occuring randomly and indepedently)


    - ㅅ = rambda
    - P(X=x) = (ㅅ^x * e^(-ㅅ))/x!
    - x can be any non negative integer (whole number)
        -> 0, 1, 2, ...., infinity
    mean = rambda
    variance = rambda

    E.g
    - plutonium-239 have an average of 2.3 radioactive decays per second
    - number of decays follow poisson distribution

    What is the probability that in a 2 second period there are exactly 3 radioactive decays?
    - Let X represent the number of decays in a 2 second period
    rambda = 2.3 * 2 = 4.6
    왜냐하면 2초니깐 * 2
    P(X=3) =  (ㅅ^x * e^(-ㅅ))/x! = 4.6^3 * e^4.6 / 3 !
           = 0.163 (3 s.f)

    There is no upper bound in Poisson Distribution but prob goes negligible

    P(X<=3) = P(X=0) + P(X=1) + P(X=2) + P(X=3)
            = 4.6^0.... +4.6^1.. + .....
            = 0.326

    The Relation Between the Binomial and Poisson Distribution

    The Binomial Distribution tends toward the Poisson Distribution as n -> infinity, p -> 0
    and np stays constant

    The Poisson Distribution with rambda = np
    closely appoximates the binomial distribution if n is large and p is small.

    This is why radioactive decays of plutonium has a poisson distribution.
    Even for a tiny bit of plutonium, there are a very large number of atoms,
    and each one has a tiny probability of experiencing a radioactive decay in a 2 seconds period

    so

    -> 그래서 Decay 하냐 안하냐는 사실 Binomial distribution 인데 -> Large N but Small p
    -> Approximates by the Poisson Distribution

    The Poisson distribution is typically used as an approximation to the true underlying reality.
    In most situations where we use the Poisson, we know the Poisson distribution doesn't fit the scenario precisely
    but we use it as an approximation. -> Very good Approximation

    포이썬이 실생활 문제를 예측 할 때 많이 쓰이는데, 문제는 포이썬이 정확히 딱 들어 맞지는 않음.
    그래서 포이선을 쓸때는  Approximation 으로 쓰는데 이게 꽤 정확홤.

    근데 문제는 random variable 이 Poisson distribution 을 따르는지 안따르는지 이걸 결정하기가 굉장히 어려움
