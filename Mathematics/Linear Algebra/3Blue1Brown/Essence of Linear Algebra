How is it useful?
    It gives physicist and computer graphics programmers to a language to describe space
    and manipulate of space using numbers that can be crunched run through computers.


    so
    think about
    what's actually going on in space??

    and then

    get the computer to represent things numerically, thereby figuring out where to place
    pixels on the screen, and doing this usually relies on linear algebra understanding.
