Basis
    - A set B = {u1, u2,....,um} is a basis for subspace S if B spans S and B is linearly independent

Subspace - if satisfies following conditions
    1) S contains 0, with zero vector
    2) (Closed under addition) If u and v are in S, the u + s is also in S
    3) (Closed under multiplication) If r is a real number and u is in S, then ru is also in S

Codomain (Output Vector)
    - A set containing *ALL POSSIBLE* output for a function,
    (note that this contains the *range* which is equal to the set of possible output for a function)

Domain (Input Vector)
    - The set of possible inputs for a function
        (T is one to one if every vector in domain of T is sent to its "Own" unique vector in the range)

Range
    - The set of output for a function = set of all vectors y such that T(x) = y
    - range(T) = range of T = image of T 
    - Subspace of codomain in R^n
    Col(A)

Dimension(Subspace) - Let S be a non-zero Subspace. Then the dimension of S is number of vectors in any basis of S.

Kernel
    - Given a linear transformation T, the set of all vectors x such that T(x) = 0 is the kernel of T, Ker(T) and is subspace 
      of the domain of T. And is Subspace of R^m
    - Ax = T(x) 
    - Ker(T) = Null(A)

Null Space
    - If A is an n*m matrix, then the set of solutions Ax = 0 is called null space of A, null(A)
    - Subspace of R^m

Nullity
    - If A is an n*m matrix, then the nullity of A , Nullity(A), is dimension of null(A)
    - dim(Null(A)) = # of free variables

Rank
    - Dimension of row spaces or dimension of column space
    - # of pivot points
    - dim(row(A)) = dim(col(A))

Rank Nullity theoreom
    - Given n * m Matrix A
    - Rank(A) + Nullity(A) = m
