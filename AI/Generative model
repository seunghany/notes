What are Generative Models?

Models that use an unsupervised learning approach in a generative model
 -> there are samples in the data that is input variables X
 -> but lacks in output variable Y
so
 -> we use the (only) input variables to train the generative model and it recognized the pattern
 from the input variables to generate an output that is unknown and based on the training data only

In supervised learning,
we are more aligned towards creating predictive models from the input variables and this type of modelling
is also known as discriminative modelling.
And
In Classification problem, the model has to discriminate as to which class the example belongs to
and on the other hand, unsupervised models are used to create or generate new examples in the input distribution
to define a generative model in layman terms we can say generative models are able to generate new examples from the
new sample that are not only similar to the examples but are distinguishable as well.

and the most common example of a generative model is a knife bias classifier which is more often used.
Other discriminative model other examples of generative models include Gaussian mixture model and a rather
modern example that is generative adverse networks. so let us try to understand what exactly are GANs
or genrative adverse real networks.

Generative adversarial network or GANs are deep learning based generative model that is used for unsupervised learning
