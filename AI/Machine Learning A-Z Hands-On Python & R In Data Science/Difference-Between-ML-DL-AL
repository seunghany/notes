Artificial Intelligence
Science that mimics human intelligence such as decision making, text processing, and visual conception.
AI is a broader field (i.e the big umbrella) that contains several subfield such as machine learning, robotics, and computer vision

Machine Learning
Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to improve at a given task with experience.
Note --> All Machine Learning techniques are classified as Artificial Intelligence ones.

However, not all Aritificial Intelligence could count as Machine Learning since some basic Rule-based engines could be classified as AI but they
do not learn from experience therefore cannot be classified as Machine Learning.

Machine Learning
1. Supervised Learning (지도학습)
    Training Algorithms using labeled input/output data.
    - Classification (분류)
    - Clustering (군집화/클러스터링)
2. Unsupervised Learning (비지도학습)
    Training Algorithms with no labeled data. It attempts at discovering hidden patterns on its own.
    - Clustering
3. Reinforcement Learning (강화학습)
    - Algorithms that actions to maximize cumulative reward.

Deep Learning
    Deep learning is a specialized field of Machine learning that relies on training of Deep Aritificial Neural Networks(ANNs) using a large
dataset such as images or texts.
- Deep Learning is information processing model inspired by human Brain
Information Processing Model (https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+information+processing+model&rlz=1C1CHBF_koUS897US897&sxsrf=ALeKk02OF-J8aTVTdm76b4fNC5VzoqaQZA:1609593703121&tbm=isch&source=iu&ictx=1&fir=rcqnxJMdJIS8lM%252CiGA_RZKEGPY8VM%252C_&vet=1&usg=AI4_-kSjIs0tzFs-f5hNaOS8CxDXxFqv8w&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj1v6Dnq_3tAhUjCqYKHa7jDuwQ9QF6BAgyEAE&biw=1367&bih=782#imgrc=rcqnxJMdJIS8lM)
- 딥러닝은 사람의 뇌를 본따 만든 정보처리 모델이다.

The human brain consists of billions of neurons that communicate to each other using electrical and chemical signals
and enable humans to see, feel, and make decision. ANNs works by mathematically mimicking the human brain and connecting multiple 
"Artificial" neurons in a mulilayered fashion. The more hidden layers added to the network, the deeper the network gets.

정리
1. 딥러닝은 사람의 뇌를 본따 만들었다.
2. 사람의 뇌는 셀수 없는 뉴론이 서로 정보를 교환하는데, 딥러닝은 이것을 "인공적인" 뉴론을 만들어 수학적으로 규현하였다.
3. 이 인공적인 뉴론은 레이어로 이루어져 있는데, 이 레이어가 많을수록 네트워크는 더 성능이 좋아진다.

What differentiated deep learning from from machine learning techniques is in their ability to extract features
automatically as illustrated in the following example.

Machine Learning Process 
1) Selecting the model to train
2) Manually performing feature extraction
