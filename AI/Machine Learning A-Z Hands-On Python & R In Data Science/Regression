Simple Linear Regression
    - Predict the value of one variable y based on another variable X
        -> X is called Independent V ariable
        -> y is called Dependent Variable
    - Why do we call it simple?
        -> Because it examines the relationship between two variables only.
    - Why do we call it linear?
        -> Because as independent increases or decreases, dependent variable increases or decreases in a linear fashion
        -> 간단하게 말해서 같이 늘어나고 같이 줄어든다. --> 일직선을 만든다.
    Formula
    - y = mX + B
        -> m = coeffcient = slope of the line
        -> B = y intercept

Multiple Linear Regression
    - Predict the value of one variable y based on multiple variable x1,x2,x3.....xn
    
    Formula
    - y = b0 + x1m1 + x2m2 + x3m3+ ......xnmn

Polynomial Regression 
    - Models the relationship between independent variable X and the dependent variable Y as nth degree polynomial X

    Formula
    y = b0 + b1x + b2x^2 + b3x^3 + .... bnx^n
